# 🎯 QUICK FIX CHECKLIST

## Your Error:
```
❌ new row violates row-level security policy for table "objects"
❌ user_name: supabase_storage_admin
```

---

## ✅ 3-MINUTE FIX

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
🔗 https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xfzrzlnhdyzslhzurxce

### Step 2: Navigate to SQL Editor
Left sidebar → SQL Editor → "+ New query"

### Step 3: Copy & Paste This SQL
```sql
-- Allow uploads to bill bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow all uploads to bill bucket"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'bill');

-- Allow viewing bills  
CREATE POLICY "Allow all to view bills"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'bill');

-- Allow updates
CREATE POLICY "Allow all to update bills"
ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE
USING (bucket_id = 'bill')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'bill');

-- Allow deletes
CREATE POLICY "Allow all to delete bills"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE
USING (bucket_id = 'bill');
```

### Step 4: Click "RUN" (F5)
You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 5: Test Your Upload
Try uploading a bill again!

## 🔍 Verify It Worked

Run this query to check:
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' AND policyname LIKE '%bill%';
```

Should return 4 policies.

---

## 💡 Why This Works

Your storage bucket had **RLS enabled** but **ZERO policies**.

Without policies = **EVERYTHING BLOCKED** ❌

With policies = **Uploads allowed** ✅

---

## 🆘 Emergency Option

If SQL doesn't work:

1. Go to: Dashboard → Storage → Policies
2. Find the **bill** bucket
3. Toggle **"Enable RLS"** to **OFF**
4. This disables security (not recommended for production)

---

## Next Steps After Fix

Once uploads work:

1. ✅ Test thoroughly
2. ✅ Consider adding user-specific folders
3. ✅ Review security policies for production
4. ✅ Maybe switch to Supabase Auth for better security
